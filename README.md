## Project Title
**Bike Rental Demand Forecasting**

## Background
As pandemic arises, everything is changing to be non-contact. According to the New York Times, “social-distancing, sustainability, and accessibility helped accelerate e-biking during the pandemic, and the trend is showing up in urban bike-sharing programs” (Glusac, 2021). A bike-sharing system is a process where people can rent a bike and return it automatically. Through this system, a user is able to rent a bike from certain places and return it to another location. The demand for bike-sharing is increasing, and therefore, at the same time, bike rental companies such as Capital BikeShare have problems analyzing and predicting the demand of bike rental for their companies.

## Description
- As the data analysis team of the company Analytopedia, our business goal is to assist our client, Capital BikeShare, a bike-sharing company, to forecast the demand for bike rental. The data we provide would allow the company to optimize its profit by increasing revenue and utilizing the optimal time when users use bikes the most, ultimately providing enough bikes for users.

- As a supervised learning and regression problem, our data mining goal is to use historical data to see how each feature affects the target variable, which is the number of bike rentals, and to predict the future demand. We would like to figure out which features have a strong impact on the target variable result and focus on these features to provide a systematic plan for companies to follow.
